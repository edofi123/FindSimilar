# FindSimilar
Find similar images(png/jpg) inside a directory with Python

Do you have lots of images?
Did your friend sent you the same images every two weeks?
Do you need to free some storage off your computer?

I am here for you!

Give FindSimilar a path to picture directory, 
Choose how accurate you want it to be,
After few calculations it will notify you about similar images and will delete those if you want to!
A very easy way to arrange your images!

Hope you will like it :)
